# IBM-Data-Science
This repository contains some of the work undertaken when I was doing the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate on Coursera.

All work shown here is for the purpose of demonstrating my skills and is not meant to undermine the work put into these courses by the staff at coursera.
All workbooks have changes made to them to prevent other students from being able to copy over the exact same work for their assignments.

Jupyter notebooks do not seem to work on GitHub so please use a compatible third party software to view the content.
